## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This project was a simple one.
The main thing i learnt was interepreting a figma file for my development.
I extracted useful info like font size, spacing, color withoud depending on the /asset folder that came with this starter folder.
It was fun :)
